Forge 1.20.1 Mod that adds narcotics, and lacing of foods, and (Eventual) visual effects for them all.

- IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER -------------

For effects to render correctly your GUI scale has to be at 1, atm I will try to fix this but i'm kinda a dumbass

This mod was made for a specific server, do not expect requests to be met or updates to newer versions. If you ask I will ignore you.

This mod is about drugs and has OD mechanics, so if you're a baby don't use it.

- Bug reports -------------

Use issues for bugs you find. Provide instructions and logs. (if applicable)

- Installation ----------

**CURRENTLY THERE IS NOT A PUBLIC PREBUILT .JAR, I WILL RELEASE ONE WHEN I'M HAPPY THE MOD IS IN A PLAYABLE STATE**

If you wish to build it yourself, just put this into your IDE and build it yourself. If you don't know how watch a yt tutorial or something idk.

Then install forge for minecraft 1.20.1 and drag and drop dependencies and the .jar into your mods folder. IT MUST BE INSTALLED BOTH SERVER AND CLIENT!
