Q: Why not change version/modloader
A: Im lazy and don't want to learn Fabric.

Q: How do I get hemp or poppy seeds?
A: Wandering traders and Farmer villagers sell Hemp seeds, and you get poppy seeds from poppes.

Q: What substances are currently added?
A: Cannabis, absinthe, and Opium. psychadelic Mushrooms are planned after I get shaders to work.

Q: Why is my screen black when I take something?!
A: Either 1. I accidently uploaded a broken version (TELL ME PLEASE!) 2. Your hardware isn't compatible (Mac may or may not be completly broken, I don't own a mac to test sorry)
I will upload a client side version swap that disables all shaders incase this occurs. DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO.
